### Project Title
Uyai's Bikeshare Project for Udacity Course: Introduction to Programming with Python

### Description
This was the second project in my Udacity class: Introduction to Programming with Python. In this project, we were given data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. We had to compare the system usage between three large cities: **Chicago**, **New York City**, and **Washington, DC** in the United States.

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

1. Start Time
2. End Time
3. Trip Duration
4. Start Station
5. End Station
6. User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have data for gender and birth years.

*If you select these cities, you will be able to get data by gender and birth year. This is unavailable for Washington*

### Files used
The files used are as follows:
1. chicago.csv
2. new_york_city.csv
3. washington.csv

*These files are available in my repo.*
