### Date created
This project was created on 11th March, 2020 for my Udacity Course: Introduction to Programming with Python

### Project Title
Uyai's Bikeshare Project

### Description
This was the second project in my Udacity class: Introduction to Programming with Python. In this project, we were given data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. We had to compare the system usage between three large cities: **Chicago**, **New York City**, and **Washington, DC** in the United States.

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

1. Start Time
2. End Time
3. Trip Duration
4. Start Station
5. End Station
6. User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have data for gender and birth years.

*If you select these cities, you will be able to get data by gender and birth year. This is unavailable for Washington*

### Statistics Shown in this Program
The code shows the following information:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

* most common month
* most common day of week
* most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip

* most common start station
* most common end station
* most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration

* total travel time
* average travel time

#4 User info

* counts of each user type
* counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
* earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Files used
The files used are as follows:
1. chicago.csv
2. new_york_city.csv
3. washington.csv

*These files are available in my repo.*
